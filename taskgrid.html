        <p>qCSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of web pages. It works alongside HTML by defining how elements like text, images, and layouts should appear in the browser. With CSS, you can change colors, fonts, spacing, alignments, and even create animations. It helps keep HTML clean by separating content from design. CSS can be written directly inside HTML using the <style> tag, included as a separate file (.css), or applied inline to specific elements. There are different types of CSS – inline, internal, and external – each serving different use cases. Overall, CSS makes websites look attractive, responsive, and user-friendly across different devices and screen sizes.
